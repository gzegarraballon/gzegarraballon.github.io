	DO with the design blurring the line between time, place and trend concepts, daytime to night, customizable; is taking effort in Turkey, Istanbul in 2016 for the effort to become a brand that is effortless but flashy, not perfect but confident, unpretentious but ambitious.

	Duygu Özaslan has started to work in various fashion magazines and then started to work. After a while, when she found herself in the beauty pages, she was asked to make a lot of makeup, and on 2013 she decided to open a Youtube channel in the beauty and fashion category that she shared her own experiences with. Duygu has set up her own company, while her short success in the channel has made her an opportunity to work with more than half a million subscribers on Youtube, the most watched "vlogger" in her category, the most influential "influencer" on Instagram and more than 40 global brands. Again and again taking a risk, about a year ago, she began to think, grow and create for his own branded DO, a childhood dream.
