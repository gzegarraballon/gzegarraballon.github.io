<center><p style="font-size:36px">(this is the room I always remember from my childhood, the room where my grandfather took a <a href="Cafe.html">photo</a> of me sitting on the short set of stairs. these stairs didn't lead anywhere, but I still remember the moment vividly. the <a href="Cafe.html">photo</a> has always been pinned up on the refrigerater door at our house, the walls the same shade of blue, Santa Catalina blue as we call it. Each time I go back, I ask whoever I'm with to help me recreate this moment)</p></center>
