<h2>This is going to say something BEAUTIFUL</h2>
<body>
<p> I was alone and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on to an oar, an adult tiger in front of me,
sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me. Had I considered my prospects in the light of reason, I surely
would have given up and let go of the oar, hoping that I might drown before being eaten. But I don’t recall
that I had a single thought during those first minutes of relative safety. I didn’t even notice daybreak. I held
on to the oar, I just held on, God only knows why.</p>

<p> The elements allowed me to go on living. The lifeboat did not sink. Richard Parker kept out of sight. The
sharks prowled but did not lunge. The waves splashed me but did not pull me off.</p>
<p> I watched the ship as it disappeared with much burbling and belching. Lights flickered and went out. I
looked about for my family, for survivors, for another lifeboat, for anything that might bring me hope. There
was nothing. Only rain, marauding waves of black ocean and the flotsam of tragedy.</p>
<p> The darkness melted away from the sky. The rain stopped. </p>
<p> I could not stay in the position I was in forever. I was cold. My neck was sore from holding up my head and
from all the craning I had been doing. My back hurt from leaning against the lifebuoy. And I needed to be
higher up if I were to see other lifeboats.</p>
<p> In the morning I could not move. I was pinned by weakness to the tarpaulin. Even thinking was exhausting. I
applied myself to thinking straight. At length, as slowly as a caravan of camels crossing a desert, some
thoughts came together.</p>
