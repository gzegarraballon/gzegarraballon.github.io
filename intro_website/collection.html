	Everyone has stories, moments, memories, instances in which &ldquo;you had to be there.&rdquo;
 	<br><br> Awkward or funny times which are only relevant to those who experienced them in the moment. <br><br> These gifs and quotes are a collection of those related to my life. <br><br> The &ldquo;you had to be there&rdquo;moments that have stuck out to me and that I rememeber fondly.<br><br> <a href="https://iguessyoujusthadtobethere.tumblr.com/">I guess you just had to be there.</a>
